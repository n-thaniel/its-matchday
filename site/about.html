      <p>
        It can be frustrating to figure out what match is on what service because of rights ($$$). I hope to achieve two main goals with this website:
        <ul>
            <li>Make it easy to understand who the rights holders are for each major league in your country. Therefore, what services you need to watch your team.</li>
            <li>Frictionless discovery of matches and what service they are on for all major leagues in your country.</li>
        </ul>
        <break></break>
        This will be a team effort. If you want to contribute you can <a href="https://github.com/n-thaniel/its-matchday">visit the repository on GitHub.</a>
